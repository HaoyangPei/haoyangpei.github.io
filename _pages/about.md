Welcome! This site highlights my research, projects, and talks on accelerated MRI and deep learning. Explore the sections below to find publications, slides, course materials, and creative work.

## Quick links
- **Research**: Recent papers, preprints, and code snippets focused on self-supervised MRI reconstruction. Visit the [publications](/publications/) page for details.
- **Talks**: Slides and recordings from conferences and workshops. See the [talks](/talks/) archive.
- **Teaching**: Course materials and mentoring notes. Browse the [teaching](/teaching/) section.
- **Resume**: A concise overview of experience and skills is available on the [resume](/cv/) page.

## Highlights
- Showcased **DeepGrasp**, a self-supervised model for 4D golden-angle radial MRI, at the 2026 ISMRM Data Sampling & Image Reconstruction workshop.
- Released a **Hybrid Learning** framework for joint low-field MRI reconstruction and denoising, combining self-supervised and supervised stages.
- Demonstrated deep-learning-based DSC perfusion mapping generated directly from DCE acquisitions to reduce additional contrast injections.
