I am a PhD candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at New York University Tandon School of Engineering and a research assistant at NYU Langone Health's Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research. My work combines self-supervised and hybrid deep learning with accelerated MRI acquisition to deliver faster, higher-quality 4D reconstructions and quantitative mapping across organs, field strengths, and contrast mechanisms.

### Latest updates
- **Jan 2026**: Presented **DeepGrasp** at the ISMRM Workshop on Data Sampling & Image Reconstruction (oral), showcasing a single self-supervised model for highly accelerated 4D golden-angle radial MRI across organs.
- **2025**: Released the **Hybrid Learning** framework for joint MRI reconstruction and denoising in low-field settings (under review) and received Dr. Li's Publication Award at NYU Tandon.

### Research highlights
- **DeepGrasp**: foundation-style self-supervised model for highly accelerated 4D golden-angle radial MRI that generalizes across organs, spatial resolutions, and temporal dynamics while cutting inference to milliseconds per slice.
- **Hybrid Learning**: two-stage self-supervised + supervised pipeline for joint MRI reconstruction and denoising when only low-SNR references are available, demonstrated on low-field lung and brain imaging.
- **DeepEMC-T2 & Deep LLIR T1 mapping**: deep learning approaches for parameter mapping that reduce echoes or acquisition time while improving estimation accuracy.
- **Contrast-efficient imaging**: generated DSC-MRI perfusion maps directly from DCE data to avoid additional contrast injections and mitigate susceptibility artifacts.
