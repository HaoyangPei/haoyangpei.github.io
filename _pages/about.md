Welcome! I am a PhD candidate at NYU Tandon and a research assistant at NYU Langone Health working on accelerated MRI reconstruction, quantitative imaging, and reliable deployment of deep learning in clinical workflows.

## What I'm focusing on
- Self-supervised and physics-informed reconstruction for highly undersampled acquisitions.
- Quantitative mapping methods that stay robust across field strengths and scanners.
- Translating research code into reproducible, well-documented tools for collaborators.

## Recent highlights
- **DeepGrasp (ISMRM 2026)**: Self-supervised 4D golden-angle radial MRI reconstruction with improved motion handling. See the [publication](/publications/2026-01-15-deepgrasp-ismrm/).
- **Hybrid Learning for low-field MRI (2025)**: Combining self-supervised and supervised stages for denoising and reconstruction. Read more in [Hybrid Learning](/publications/2025-01-01-hybrid-learning/).
- **DCE-to-DSC perfusion mapping (2024)**: Generating DSC maps directly from DCE acquisitions to avoid additional contrast injections. Details are in [this work](/publications/2024-11-01-dce-to-dsc/).
