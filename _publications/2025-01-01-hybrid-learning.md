We propose Hybrid Learning, a two-stage training scheme that first self-supervises on noisy k-space and then fine-tunes with paired low-SNR references to jointly reconstruct and denoise accelerated MRI. The method outperforms self-supervised and supervised baselines across low-field lung and brain studies at 0.55 T and 0.3 T.
