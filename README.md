# About me

This repository hosts my personal site built with Jekyll and the academic-pages theme.

## How to verify changes

- **Locally**: run `bundle install` followed by `bundle exec jekyll build` to make sure the site generates without errors.
- **CI**: every push and pull request now runs the same build in GitHub Actions so broken pages are caught early.
